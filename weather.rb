# def description(weather)
  
#   	weather = {
#     :city => ["New York"],
#     :description => ["partly cloudy"],

# 3. Using the methods above and string interpolation, update the method below so that it returns a string that describes the current weather - for example: "The weather in New York is Partly Cloudy. The temperature is 66.1 degrees Farenheit." HINT: the method should RETURN the string, not print it to the terminal. 


#4. Write a method that takes in the weather hash as an argument. 
# You'll want to use the each method to iterate over the hash and print out
# `The city is New York.` `The description is Partly Cloudy.` `The temperature is 66.3.`


# BONUS:  Write a method that takes in the weather hash as an argument and converts the farenheit temperature to celcius. Have the method round your answer to two decimal places. Is there a method we can use to round in Ruby?

# Hint - how can we find the algorithm to convert Farenheit to Celsius?
